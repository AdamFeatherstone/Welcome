<h1>Welcome to my Web Development Journey!</h1>

<h2>The Story So Far...</h2>
<p>My name is Adam Featherstone, and I am a Graphic Designer from the UK. 
    I have built websites before- mostly using Wordpress, and now I want to get more
    involved in the nuts and bolts of it all, and learn Web Development. <p />
<br>
    Whilst I have some previous experience, and am not starting from complete scratch, 
    the overall message I keep seeing is that for it all to sink in, the best thing is to just DO.
    <br />
      <p>So I will start from the very beginning, and take this well trodden approach:<p/>

   <li>HTML</li>
   <li>CSS</li>
   <li>Javascript</li>
